This is the Spacious IGB. The algorithm is based on Euclidean generation. 
It is customizable for the user. It can randomize the order of sequences or keep a steady sequence looped.
The overall vibe of the generator is spacey. The questions in User Input is made to fit with that vibe. It consists of 3 files.
- Main -> the main file for the execution of the program and midi write
- Functions -> Almost all of the functions for generation and conversion
- UI_File -> The functions for UI inputs.
